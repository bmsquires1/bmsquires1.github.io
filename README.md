 *  #About Me
   ##I am gennerally found at home, at work, or at school. I lead a mostly boring, albeit busy, life. I love my job, I love learning, and time with my family is one of my most treasured experiences. I do enjoy the occasional video game. Stardew Valley on the switch is a current favorite. I love animals of all varieties, though cats and dogs are among my favorite.
